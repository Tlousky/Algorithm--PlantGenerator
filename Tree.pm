# After much thought, I have decided that it will be much simpler to ditch the length
# And use dX and dY ranges instead.
# This way it will be much easier to calculate the endpoint, and it will be possible
# to simply determin the direction of the branch:
# dX < 0 => left
# dX > 0 => right
# dY > 0 => up   ( ascending  )
# dY < 0 => down ( descending )
