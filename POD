=head1 <i>Algorithm::Shape::RandomTree</i>

This module creates an object which holds the data representing a tree shape, in a like named object.
This tree object is build of a collection of branches, which in turn are built of pairs of coordinates
(start and end point for each branch). This module calculates The tree's shape using two possible algorithms,
one is recursive, and the other linear. Both contain lots of random elements required to create a more realistic
tree-shape, and the difference is that the recursive algorith gives more realistic results, while the linear
algorithm gives more control over the overall size and complexity of the tree shape.
